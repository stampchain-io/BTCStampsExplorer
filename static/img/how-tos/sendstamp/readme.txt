Art Stamps
On the Stampchain.io platform, users can choose between Classic Stamps and Posh Stamps:
Classic Stamps are NFTs based on the 2014 Counterparty protocol. 
Initially designed to be issued 1:1, creators can now mint billions of tokens per stamp. 
Early transactions used OP_MULTISIG and Base64 encoding, while newer formats like OLGA and P2WSH have been introduced to enhance data resilience and prevent accidental spending. 
The first Bitcoin Stamp (Stamp 0) was minted by @Mikeinspace at Block 779652, marking the beginning of this immutable digital art form on the Bitcoin blockchain.
Posh Stamps are an enhanced version of cursed stamps, integrated with the Counterparty asset-naming system. 
While they require acquiring XCP (Counterparty's native token) to follow the Meta-Protocol rules, this allows artists to create custom, on-chain vanity names for their stamps and collections. 
This feature gives creators more flexibility and branding options while adhering to the blockchain's naming conventions.

Both types of stamps ensure immutability and permanence within the blockchain.

OLGA:
OLGA is a new encoding format in the Stamps protocol that eliminates the need for Base64 encoding. It reduces transaction sizes by 50% and minting costs by 60–70% while preserving original functionality. First implemented in Block 833000, OLGA enhances storage efficiency for images on the Bitcoin blockchain, making STAMPS up to 64kB more accessible and cost-effective.
