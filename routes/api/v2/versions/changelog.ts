        "Replaced onlyMintable and onlyFullyMinted boolean parameters with single mintingStatus enum parameter for cleaner API design",
        "price_btc field in market_data object for fungible SRC-20 tokens (replacing NFT-oriented floor_price_btc)",
        "SQL-level filtering for mintingStatus parameter using src20_market_data.progress_percentage for optimal performance",

        "OpenAPI schema validation errors in path parameter definitions",
        "Market data schema inconsistencies between SRC-20 and Stamps endpoints",
        "✅ CRITICAL: SRC20 market_data field standardization - Unified snake_case naming across all endpoints for consistency with stamp API patterns",
        "✅ BREAKING: Field name changes for consistency: floor_unit_price → floor_price_btc, mcap → market_cap_btc, volume24 → volume_24h_btc",
        "✅ ENHANCED: Added missing volume timeframes - volume_7d_btc and volume_30d_btc now included in all SRC20 market_data responses",
        "✅ MIDDLEWARE: Fixed v2.2 API middleware to properly strip market_data field (was using incorrect camelCase 'marketData' instead of 'market_data')",
        "Eliminated redundant market data enrichment code paths in SRC20 services to ensure single source of truth",
        "Newman API test validation updated to expect standardized field names and comprehensive volume timeframes",

      ],
      removed: [
        "floorPrice, floorPriceUSD, marketCapUSD moved into marketData object in stamp detail endpoints",
        "❌ DEPRECATED: Old field names floor_unit_price, mcap, volume24 - Use standardized snake_case equivalents",
      ],
      notes: [
        "📊 Market Data Coverage: 25.2% of tokens have price data, 93.1% have holder data, 18.2% have volume data",
        "✅ COMPLETED: Balance endpoints normalized to use standardized MarketDataEnrichmentService with complete v2.3 field structure",
        "🔄 Migration: Update client code to use new field names: floor_price_btc, market_cap_btc, volume_24h_btc, volume_7d_btc, volume_30d_btc",
        "✅ Backward Compatibility: v2.2 API continues to work without market_data fields via X-API-Version header",
        "🚀 Performance: Balance endpoints benefit from 93% performance improvement through cached market data infrastructure",
