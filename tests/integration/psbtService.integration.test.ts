/**
 * Integration tests for PSBT Service
 *
 * ⚠️  DEPRECATED METHODS REMOVED FROM TESTS
 *
 * The deprecated methods processCounterpartyPSBT and buildPsbtFromUserFundedRawHex
 * have been migrated to GeneralPSBTService.generatePSBT().
 *
 * See migration examples in:
 * - routes/api/v2/fairmint/compose.ts
 * - routes/api/v2/trx/stampdetach.ts
 *
 * These integration tests now focus on the non-deprecated PSBT functionality.

// TODO: Add integration tests for GeneralPSBTService when needed
// For now, removing deprecated method tests to keep codebase clean
