/* ===== STAMPCHAIN LOGO ICON COMPONENT ===== */
/*
 * Renders the Stampchain logo as an <img> tag loading the SVG from static assets.
 *
 * The logo SVG uses linearGradient paint servers with xlink:href stop inheritance.
 * Inline SVG approaches (JSX, dangerouslySetInnerHTML) all fail in this context
 * because the Header is a Fresh island: the SVG is server-rendered during SSR and
 * then Preact re-hydrates the island client-side. During that hydration cycle,
 * gradient url(#id) references silently break — paths with solid hex stroke colours
 * survive but any path using stroke:url(#gradient) becomes invisible.
 *
 * Loading via <img src="...svg"> sidesteps this entirely: the browser fetches and
 * parses the file as a standalone SVG document where xlink:href and all gradient
 * references work as designed, with no Preact/hydration involvement.
 *
 *       ORIGINAL IMG TAG:
 *       <img
        src="/img/logo/logo-duotone-gradient.svg"
        alt=""
        class="w-9 h-9 tablet:w-8 tablet:h-8"
      />
