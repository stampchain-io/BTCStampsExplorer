/* ===== CONTENT FORMATTING DOCUMENTATION ===== */
/**
 * FAQ DESCRIPTION AND CONTENT FORMATTING
 *
 * There are two ways of formatting decription text and three ways to format FAQ content:
 *
 * 1. Single line - for simple answers
 *    description/content: "Simple one line answer"
 *
 * 2. Line breaks within a paragraph - using \n
 *    description/content: "First line with basic info\nSecond line with more details\nThird line with final points"
 *
 * 3. Multiple paragraphs - using array - recommended for longer answers
 *    content: [
 *      "First paragraph that can also\nhave line breaks",
 *      "Second completely separate paragraph",
 *      "Third paragraph with more\nline breaks\nand content"
 *    ]
 *
 * The FAQ component will maintain proper spacing:
 * - \n = line break (less space)
 * - Array items = new paragraphs (more space)
