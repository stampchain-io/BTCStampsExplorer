# Performance Optimization PRD - BTCStampsExplorer Client-Side Resource Consumption

## Project Overview
Optimize BTCStampsExplorer to reduce client-side resource consumption while maintaining all existing functionality and visual appearance. Users report high browser resource usage when the application window is open.

## Problem Statement
Users experience high CPU/GPU usage and battery drain when BTCStampsExplorer is open in their browser, even when not actively interacting with the site. Analysis has identified several resource-intensive operations running continuously.

## Technical Requirements

### Critical Performance Issues (Phase 1)
1. **Infinite Skeleton Animation Optimization**
   - Stop shimmer animations when loading completes
   - Pause animations when elements are not in viewport
   - Maintain visual loading states and user experience
   - Implement Page Visibility API to pause when tab is inactive

2. **localStorage Polling Optimization**
   - Replace 1-second localStorage polling in UploadImageTable
   - Implement event-driven wallet state management
   - Maintain real-time wallet connection status
   - Preserve all existing wallet functionality

3. **Animation Performance Controls**
   - Add animation-play-state controls for CSS animations
   - Implement intersection observer for viewport-based animation control
   - Maintain smooth visual transitions and loading states

### Moderate Performance Issues (Phase 2)
4. **Fee Polling Consolidation**
   - Create global fee state management service
   - Eliminate duplicate fee polling across components
   - Maintain real-time fee updates for all components
   - Preserve existing fee calculation accuracy

5. **Auto-Refresh Optimization**
   - Implement smart refresh for StampSales component
   - Pause auto-refresh when page is not visible
   - Add user activity detection
   - Maintain real-time sales data updates

6. **GPU Optimization**
   - Consolidate multiple gradient background layers
   - Optimize CSS compositing layers
   - Maintain exact visual appearance
   - Preserve all gradient effects

### Performance Monitoring (Phase 3)
7. **Performance Tracking Implementation**
   - Add performance monitoring and metrics
   - Implement resource usage tracking
   - Create performance regression detection
   - Add user-facing performance indicators

## Technical Constraints
- **Zero Functionality Loss**: All existing features must work identically
- **Visual Consistency**: Maintain exact visual appearance and animations
- **Fresh Framework**: Work within Deno Fresh 2.3.1 architecture
- **Preact Compatibility**: Ensure all optimizations work with Preact islands
- **Cloudflare Integration**: Consider existing Cloudflare optimizations

## Success Criteria
- Reduce idle CPU usage by 70%+ when tab is inactive
- Eliminate unnecessary polling and continuous operations
- Maintain sub-100ms response times for all user interactions
- Pass all existing functionality tests
- Zero visual regression in UI/UX

## Implementation Strategy
- Implement changes incrementally with testing at each phase
- Use feature flags for gradual rollout if needed
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Focus on highest-impact, lowest-risk changes first

## Testing Requirements
- Performance benchmarking before and after changes
- Cross-browser compatibility testing
- Mobile device performance testing
- User acceptance testing for functionality preservation
- Automated regression testing for visual consistency
