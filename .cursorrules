Code Style and Structure:

- Write concise, technical TypeScript code based on Deno Fresh with accurate
  examples
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns where appropriate
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading,
  hasError)
- Structure files: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content,
  types
  - use the mappings in deno.json for reference to all libraries. This is the
    replacement for import_map

Naming Conventions:

- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard)
- Favor named exports for components

TypeScript Usage:

- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types
- Avoid enums; use const objects for enumerations
- Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces

Syntax and Formatting:

- Use the "function" keyword for component definitions
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple
  statements
- Use declarative JSX

Error Handling and Validation:

- Prioritize error handling: handle errors and edge cases early
- Use early returns and guard clauses
- Implement proper error logging and user-friendly messages
- Handle errors in route handlers and return appropriate responses

UI and Styling:

- Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS; use a mobile-first approach
- use class instead of className as the preferred method for Deno Fresh

Performance Optimization:

- Use islands for client-side interactivity
- Optimize images: use WebP format, include size data, implement lazy loading

Routing:

- Use file-based routing in the `routes/` directory
- Create dynamic routes using square brackets (e.g., [id].tsx)
- Implement _app.tsx for global layout and _404.tsx for custom 404 pages
- Use the `<Partial>` component from "$fresh/runtime.ts" for partial page
  updates only when needed and rely on Deno Fresh server-side rendering
  capabilities when suitable

Islands:

- Place interactive components in the `islands/` directory
- Keep islands small and focused on specific interactive functionality
- Use islands only for components that require client-side interactivity
- Prefer server-side rendering where possible

Plugins:

- Utilize Fresh plugins for extending functionality (e.g., Tailwind CSS)
- Create custom plugins in a `plugins/` directory when needed
- Register plugins in the `fresh.config.ts` file
- Use plugin-specific components and utilities as provided by each plugin

Fresh-specific Practices:

- Use the `Head` component from "$fresh/runtime.ts" for managing document head
- Implement server-side rendering by default, using islands only for interactive
  components
- Utilize Fresh's built-in static file serving from the `static/` directory
- Take advantage of Fresh's automatic HMR (Hot Module Replacement) during
  development
- Use the `handler` function in route files for server-side data fetching and
  processing

components/:
- Server-side rendered (SSR)
- No client-side JavaScript
- Rendered on the server and sent as HTML
Example: StampBalanceCard.tsx - static layout component

islands/:
- Client-side interactive components
- Include JavaScript that runs in browser
- Can use hooks, state, event handlers
Example: BlockInfo.tsx - has state and useEffect
